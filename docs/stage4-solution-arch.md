# Solution Architecture Overview

## Introduction

The requirements of Everscale SSI contest Stage 4 demand that a proposed solution must provide 
a basic implementation of SSI Triangle of Trust with Issuer, Holder, Verifier roles, and also VC issuance 
and verification procedures.

The core conception that drives the architectural decisions Identix team have made is 
[Verifiable Credential Brokerage Protocol](vc-brokerage-overview.md). The design described in this document 
and the working solution delivered as a nomination for the contest implement a part of VCBP, the basic subset of
roles, operations and components, necessary to meet the contest's criteria.
